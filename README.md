# Explore US Bikeshare Data (Programming for data science)


### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data :bike:

### Description
using Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. written code will import the data and answer interesting questions and create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these descriptive statistics.

### Software Needed
1. You should have Python 3, NumPy, and pandas installed using Anaconda
2. A text editor, like Sublime or Atom.
3. A terminal application (Terminal on Mac and Linux or Cygwin on Windows).

### Files used
* chicago.csv
* new_york_city.csv
* washington.csv

### The Datasets
All three of the data files contain the same columns:

* Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
* End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
* Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
* Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
* End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
* User Type (Subscriber or Customer)
* Gender
* Birth Year

_Except the city of Washington has no Gender and Birth Year data._

### Statistics Computed
The written code will answers the following questions:

1. Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)
2. Popular stations and trip
3. Trip duration
4. User info
